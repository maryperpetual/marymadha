<div class="aboutthechurch">
    "Mary Perpetual Help Church" (SAGAYA MADHA CHURCH) is the most common name used by the people. 
    This church maintains two churches as king Christ church and St.Antony church.
    This Church is most popular for wonder and miracle, because of the praying to Jesus(The Father), and the People are getting many benefits through him.<br><br>
    The Churches of Christ are represented across the world. The Churches of Christ arose to prominence in TamilNadu 16th century.
    Christianity was introduced to India in the 1st century AD. According to tradition, Saint Thomas the Apostle is believed to have arrived in the southern part of India in 52 AD and established Christian communities. 
    This makes Christianity one of the oldest religions in India.<br><br>Over the centuries, Christianity spread to different parts of the country, and today, there is a significant Christian population in various regions of India.
    The Roman Catholic presence in India can be traced back to the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century.<br><br>In 1498, Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, reached the Malabar Coast of southwestern India, establishing trade links with the local rulers. 
    The Portuguese continued to expand their influence along the western coast of India, especially in regions such as Goa, where they established a strong colonial presence. Goa became the center of Portuguese rule and Catholic missionary activities in India.<br><br>
    During the colonial period, the Roman Catholic Church played a significant role in spreading Christianity, establishing churches, and establishing educational institutions in various parts of India. Today, the Roman Catholic Church remains one of the largest Christian denominations in India.
